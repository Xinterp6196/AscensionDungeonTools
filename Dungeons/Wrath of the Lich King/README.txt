These are all placeholders to get the main lua to redirect here.
Eventually I would like to remove all the primary calls to this folder if possible, or to its main directory.
That should allow us to change between Classic and Burning Crusade (and hopefully Wrath of the Lich King) depending
on what content we are currently doing.
